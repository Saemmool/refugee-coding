          <br>Nghiep Ke Lam’s mother brought him to America to escape violence. In Vietnam, she watched as her parents were murdered by the communist party, and in 1978, she fled with her family. But the violence followed her son. In 1997, when he was just 17, Lam murdered a rival gang member and was incarcerated for nearly two decades.

          <br>
          <br>Lam’s story isn’t unique. His experiences reflect those of Southeast Asian communities nationwide, including a group of Cambodian refugees in Stockton, California. While Asian Americans are broadly considered a “model minority,” Southeast Asian refugees and immigrants and their families often don’t live up to that stereotype. They have lower rates of educational attainment and higher rates of poverty and criminal activity.

          Experts say the trauma of fleeing conflicts, such as the Vietnam War or the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia, is likely to blame for these struggles to assimilate and succeed in America. While refugees and their families face numbers of material obstacles as they resettle, many experts say that it’s “intergenerational trauma” passed from parents fleeing wars and genocides, onto their children, that creates such disparities within the Asian American community. 
            
             
          <br>
          <br>Lam’s family fled Vietnam by boat and were quickly stranded in the South China sea. They were rescued by fishermen, who only agreed to take the family to shore in exchange for every item of value the family possessed. They then spent two years in a refugee camp in Hong Kong, finally landing in the United States as refugees in 1980. 
          <br>
          
          <br>Experts say that such unresolved trauma can affect children, even if they have not experienced the trauma themselves. 

          <br>
          <br>Kate Wadsworth, clinical director for Oakland’s Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI) has observed these issues firsthand. According to Wadsworth, CERI’s youth program was founded because of the need observed among children of Cambodian refugees, whether they were born in refugee camps or in the United States. 

          <br>
          <br>“If you’re living with a parent who is constantly hypervigilant, so they’re constantly surveying the scene to see what’s gonna happen next and be worried about what terrible thing’s gonna happen,” she said. “You’re walking down the street with them, you’re with them all the time, you become hypervigilant yourself.”

            <br>While Lam’s family struggled to resettle in the Bay Area, swaths of Cambodian immigrants were facing the same issues, just a stone’s throw away in Stockton. Stockton has the fifth largest Cambodian population in the United States. Tracing back the arrival of Cambodian refugees to this city during the late 1970’s and early 1980’s tells a larger story. Its history is emblematic of how this refugee community resettled in the United States, as well as the trauma that both shaped the challenges they faced and their steadfast resolve, which helped them re-plant roots in a new country. There is one Stockton neighborhood in particular that many call the “ground zero” of the Cambodian refugee experience: Oak Park.

            <br>
            <br>“When Cambodian families say ‘Oak Park', that's our home,” Sothea Ung explained. “It means the home of our mothers and fathers, this is the first ground for Cambodian refugees that started arriving in 1979.” 

            <br>
            <br>Ung is the program manager of the Asian Pacific Self Development and Residential Association (APSARA), a social services organization that is implanted in Stockton’s Park Village apartment complex. 

            <br>
            <br>The first Cambodian refugees to arrive in Stockton largely were sponsored to come from refugee camps in Thailand via Red Cross sponsorship and efforts. Over the years, the community continued to build as people sponsored their family members and friends to come to America. Eventually, Oak Park grew to over 2,000 Cambodian families. Though the complex was crowded and under resourced at the time, the community felt like a large family for its residents - everyone knew each other either because they were related or had met back in refugee camps or in Cambodia. For kids that grew up in Oak Park, they recalled it feeling like a large family. It’s where young kids could seamlessly run in and out of each other’s apartments and be offered to stay for dinner with their friends’ families.

            Despite the sense of community found among those immigrants who shared their experiences, however, outside of their own communities, Southeast Asians face intense isolation and ostracization.

            <br>
            <br>In 1980, Lam’s family settled down in San Francisco, Calif. They moved a lot in the city—mostly between poor neighborhoods because they didn’t have enough money. Lam was the only Asian when he grew up in a neighborhood where predominantly African-Americans live. Lam couldn’t speak English. He had different haircut, wore different clothing and ate different food from his neighbors. The kids around him mocked at him, laughed at him, threw rotten eggs at him and even attacked him with their dogs. He was facing racism for the first time in his life. He was isolated in his school, too. His teacher made him to seat outside of the classroom, because he couldn’t speak English. Lam used to get frustrated when he couldn’t understand what people say to him in his school.

            <br>
            <br>According to Wadsworth, such struggles and isolation are common among the Southeast Asian youth she has worked with.

            <br>
            <br>“Though they’re not surviving genocide, they’re having their own trauma,” she said. She explained that even the children who were born in the US still faced traumatic circumstances like impoverished neighborhoods, language barriers and crime.

            <br>
            <br>From the time they arrive in America, with little money, resources or support, refugees and their children are faced with the obstacles of learning English and assimilating to an entirely new society. They accomplish this under the cloud of horrific memories or with a parent suffering from PTSD or other health issues, mental and physical. Children of these immigrants bear all these burdens while serving as the family’s translator, social worker, and a million other things. All these factors create an environment that’s fertile for criminal organizations. 

            <br>
            <br>Compounding all these obstacles to resettlement for southeast Asians is a sense of invisibility. Because data collected by ethnicity often includes Southeast Asians under the category Asian-American or Pacific Islanders, the success of some groups masks the difficulties faced by others.

            <br>Lam remembers when he learned that using violence was okay. When he was eight or nine years old, six bullies surrounded him and gave him two choices. 

            <br>
            <br>Choice one was to fight one of them. Choice two was being beaten up. Lam pointed at the one kid and said, “I’m going to fight with him.” 

            <br>
            <br>Lam was scared and didn’t want to fight, but he kept going until the kid said “No more, no more!” 

            <br>
            <br>The bullies responded with praise and encouragement. Lam was confused. That fight taught him that violence was okay. As time went on, violence became normal for Lam. The people around him used it to solve their problems, so he used it to solve his.

            <br>
            <br>Lam’s family moved across the bay to Richmond when he was at 9th grade. It was in Richmond that Lam first got exposed to gangs. At first, he was just hanging out with them casually, not realizing that this made him “guilty by association.” He was a part of the gang, and its enemies were now his.

            <br>
            <br>Joining an Asian gang was Lam’s response to being bullied and harassed. It was just his form of feeling safe. He felt safer when there are more people to protect him. Many of the gang members had the same background with him—they were also refugees from Southeast Asian countries such as Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Their families all had the same problems.  According to a survey conducted by AYPAL, an Oakland-based AAPI advocacy group, while around ten percent of AAPI youth said they would join a gang to protect themselves from bullying, those numbers were slightly higher among Cambodian and Vietnamese youth.

            <br>
            <br>Despite the sense of community Cambodians found in their little Stockton community, the people of Oak Park also encountered these challenges. Gang violence and street crime plagued the neighborhood as young Cambodian boys - children of the first wave of refugees that were either born in Thai refugee camps or in Stockton - were led to join gangs as young as the age of nine. Many of them felt compelled to join to ensure protections and resources for their families. 

            <br>
            <br>“It makes sense to me that someone who feels like their parent is struggling and maybe not able to be present is longing for a connection,” Wadsworth said. “Gangs oftentimes fill that void, and folks growing up with family members.”

            <br>
            <br>In Richmond, Lam and his gang friends stole cars, attacked people and used drugs together. He committed his final and most serious crime when he was 17 years old: He murdered a member of a rival gang. When he turned 18, he was convicted and sentenced to 27 years to life.

            <br>Lam had desire to change but didn’t know how. it took a long time for him to learn how to be responsible. The turning point for him was, when he met older inmates and joined a program that they teach at San Quentin state prison in 2003. He heard other inmates’ story on how they ended up committing the crimes. He thought that those were similar to his story. They had gone through the same thing that he experienced. That game him the strength to open up his mouth and change. The inmates looked at the trauma together—they dealt with inter-generational trauma within themselves, which went for generations. Lam could realize how he developed the mentality of normalizing violence and why he had committed the crime. 

            <br>
            <br>‘You know what? I’m not the person that committed the crime,’ He thought to himself. ‘I can be better, I can do better.’

            <br>Despite the fact that the criminal justice system counts all Asian American inmates in the same group, lumped into the category ‘Other’ Vietnamese, Cambodian and other Southeast Asian refugees and immigrants have higher crime rates compared to their Asian American counterparts. According to a National Education Association report, for example Cambodian youth in Oakland have among the highest arrest rates 63 in 1000.

            <br>
            <br>CERI and other organizations asked Oakland Unified School District to disaggregate their data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to gain a fuller picture. For example, Asian American OUSD students had among the highest graduation rates, just over 80 percent, according to the California School Dashboard. But Cambodian-American students were much lower, around 65 percent according to AYPAL, an Oakland-based AAPI advocacy group. According to Census data, nationwide, around a third of Cambodian-Americans fail to graduate high school. Vietnamese people also face a dismally high rate, with 27 percent attaining an education level below a high school diploma.

            <br>
            <br>One study of Cambodian-Americans in Long Beach, found that nearly 90 percent rated their health as poor or fair, compared to only 41 percent of other Asian Americans and 19 percent of Californians overall. The same study found that significantly more Cambodian-Americans suffered from impaired physical functioning, at a rate of nearly 60 percent.

            <br>Compounding all these obstacles to resettlement for southeast Asians is a sense of invisibility. Because data collected by ethnicity often includes southeast Asians under the category Asian-American or Pacific Islanders.

            <br>Lam was released on parole in April 2016. He had lost his status as a legal permanent resident because he committed a felony. Even more, any noncitizen who is convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable, according to the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lam could be deported back to Vietnam but has not been deported yet because of an agreement between the United States and Vietnam—which stated that Vietnamese citizens who arrived in the U.S. before July 1995 cannot be sent back to Vietnam. He considered himself as a “stranded deportee,” which means that he is living in the U.S. but can be deported depending on the situation such as change in the 2008 agreement between the US and Vietnam.

            <br>
            <br>"Due to stringent immigration policies enacted in 1996, Southeast Asian American communities are three to four times more likely to be deported for old convictions, compared to other immigrant communities,” according to the report from NEA.

            <br>Wadsworth pointed out that the fear of deportation is just another item on the laundry list of things that her clients at CERI have to worry about. 

            <br>
            <br>That threat has become more acute even for immigrants who haven’t committed crimes. According to the NEA report, at least 15,000 immigrants from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have been given final deportation orders since 1998. Many of those receiving orders have refugee status or even have obtained green cards. All this leads to a constant fear of deportation among refugees and immigrants in these communities.

            <br>
            <br>“Even if the threat [of deportation] isn’t as pertinent to them, they still feel it,” she said. “A lot of our folks are legal in this country, and their kids are, but they still worry about it because in their country everything seemed fine...until it wasn’t.” 
          
            <br>
            <br>Many of them, like Lam, have little or no memory of the place that they were born.They may have lost their sense of the culture and language. The families they so carefully stitched back together after surviving war, trauma, immigration, resettlement, incarceration, and more, will be fractured once again.
