          <p><br>Nghiep Ke Lam, a refugee from Vietnam, had to become a parent of his baby brother at the age of 8. His mom had never really stayed at home—she had used to comeback home at around 2 a.m. and left in about two hours. His dad, who had separated from her, also didn’t care about his two sons. Lam and his brother were taken care of by an old baby sitter who was careless to them. Lam decided to take care of his brother by himself and started to skip his school until a year later, when his mom found out the absence. It took a long time for him to realize that it was part of the “intergenerational trauma” that the family experienced.
              <br><br>Lam, who is now 41, moved to the United States in 1980 with his parents. He had heard from his mom about how they moved into the country: His mom saw her parents got murdered by the communist party in Vietnam when the party took over the country. Lam’s family fled the country with boat and stranded in South China sea. They were rescued by fishermen who requested everything of value that they had, in exchange of taking them into a land. The family spent two years in a refugee camp in Hong Kong and finally landed in the United States as refugees. His mom did not deal with the trauma of her own life—witnessing her parents get murdered and had given up everything she owned. She didn’t really talk about it but she couldn’t move on.</p>

            <br>
          <p><br>Lam’s family settled down in San Francisco, Calif. They moved a lot in the city—mostly around in poor neighborhoods because they didn’t have enough money. Lam was the only Asian when he grew up in a neighborhood where predominantly African-Americans live. He dealt with a lot of racism in the first time of his life there. Lam couldn’t speak English. He had different haircut, wore different clothing and ate different food from his neighbors. The kids around him mocked at him, laughed at him, threw rotten eggs at him and even attacked him with their dogs. He was isolated in his school, too. His teacher made him to seat outside of the classroom, because he couldn’t speak English. Lam used to get frustrated when he couldn’t understand what people say to him in his school.
          <br><br>He remembers when he learned that using violence is okay. When he was 8 or 9 years old, six bullies surrounded him and said, “you have two choices.” Choice one was to fight one of them, and choice two was being beaten up. If he doesn’t fight, he had to be beaten. Lam pointed out at the one kid and said, “I’m going to fight with him.” Lam was scared and didn’t fight with the kid, but fought until the kid said “no more, no more.” Then all the bullies came up to him and said, “oh yeah, good job, good job!” Lam was confused. What he had learned from the fight was that “violence is okay.” He started to normalize violence. He started to use violence to solve his problem—everyone around him used violence to solve their problem. He started to act like everyone else around him. 
          <br><br>When Lam’s family moved to Richmond, Calif., when he was at 9thgrade, he learned about gangs in the first time of his life. At first, he started to hang out with them a lot. He didn’t know that by hanging out with them that he was part of the gang. But then enemy gang started to see him as enemy—this was a thing called, “guilty by association.” Later one, Lam got picked on by some kids. He didn’t want to be harassed. He joined an Asian gang and started to fight back. He joined the gang to not to be bullied. It was just his form of feeling safe. He felt safer when there are more people to protect him. Many of the gang members had the same background with him—they were also refugees from Southeast Asian countries such as Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Their family had the same problem. They started to commit crimes together. They stole cars, attacked people, used drugs together. That finally led Lam to commit crime when he was 17 years old—he murdered a member of other gang and sentenced to 27 years to life when he turned 18.
          <br><br><br> Lam’s story isn’t unique. Research indicates that despite stereotypes of Asian-Americans as a “model minority,” Southeast Asian immigrants, particularly those fleeing conflict, struggle to assimilate and succeed in the United States. Many children of these refugees fail to graduate from high school or get involved in criminal activity. 
          Kate Wadsworth, clinical director for Oakland’s Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI) has observed these issues firsthand. According to Wadsworth, CERI’s youth program was founded because of the need observed among children of Cambodian refugees, whether they were born in refugee camps themselves or in the United States. She explained that one of the challenges of addressing that trauma is identifying its source.
          “Though they’re not surviving genocide, they’re having their own trauma,” Wadsworth said of the Cambodian youth who either arrived in the United States when they were too young to remember the Khmer Rouge genocide or were born here. She explained that many of them faced conditions like impoverished neighborhoods, language barriers and crime, all factors that make health, education and overall success a challenge.
          Then there are those who don’t face any obvious trauma from the experience of resettlement itself but are affected by their parents’ trauma.
          “If you’re living with a parent who is constantly hypervigilant, so they’re constantly surveying the scene to see what’s gonna happen next and be worried about what terrible thing’s gonna happen and you’re walking down the street with them, you’re with them all the time, you become hypervigilant yourself. 
          One study of Cambodian-Americans in Long Beach, found that nearly 90 percent rated their health as poor or fair, compared to only 41 percent of other Asian Americans and 19 percent of Californians overall. The same study found that significantly more Cambodian-Americans suffered from impaired physical functioning, at a rate of nearly 60 percent.
          Then there are the realities of being an immigrant in Trump’s America. In late 2017, the Cambodian government confirmed that the United States would deport 200 Cambodians this year, the largest number of Cambodians to be deported in a single year of U.S history. Wadsworth pointed out that the fear of deportation is just another item on the laundry list of things that CERI clients have to worry about. 
          “Even if the threat [of deportation] isn’t as pertinent to them, they still feel it,” she said. “A lot of our folks are legal in this country, and their kids are, but they still worry about it because in their country everything seemed fine...until it wasn’t.”
          Compounding all these obstacles to resettlement for southeast Asians is a sense of invisibility. Because data collected by ethnicity often includes southeast Asians under the category Asian-American or Pacific Islanders. 
          CERI and other organizations asked Oakland Unified School District to disaggregate their data on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to gain a fuller picture. For example, Asian American OUSD students had among the highest graduation rates, just over 80 percent, according to the California School Dashboard. But Cambodian-American students were much lower, around 65 percent according to AYPAL. According to Census data, nationwide, around a third of Cambodian-Americans fail to graduate high school. Vietnamese people also face a dismally high rate, with 27 percent attaining an education level below a high school diploma.
          All this indicates that Southeast Asian immigrants have the odds stacked against them. From the time they arrive in America, with little money, resources or support, refugees and their children are faced with the obstacles of learning English and assimilating to an entirely new society. They accomplish this under the specter of horrific memories or with a parent suffering from PTSD or other health issues, mental and physical. Children of these immigrants bear all these burdens while serving as the family’s translator, social worker, and a million other things. All these factors create an environment that’s fertile for criminal organizations. 
          “It makes sense to me that someone who feels like their parent is struggling and maybe not able to be present is longing for a connection,” Wadsworth said. “Gangs oftentimes fill that void, and folks growing up with family members.”

            <p>some data  may added</p>
          <p><br>Lam had desire to change but didn’t know how. it took a long time for him to learn how to be responsible. The turning point for him was, when he met older inmates and joined a program that they teach at San Quentin state prison in 2003. He heard other inmates’ story on how they ended up committing the crimes. He thought that those were similar to his story. They had gone through the same thing that he experienced. That game him the strength to open up his mouth and change. The inmates looked at the trauma together—they dealt with inter-generational trauma within themselves, which went for generations. Lam could realize how he developed the mentality of normalizing violence and why he had committed the crime. ‘You know what? I’m not the person that committed the crime,’ He thought to himself. ‘I can be better, I can do better.’
              <br><br>Lam was released on parole in April 2016. His status had changed: he had lost his status as a legal permanent resident because he committed a felony. Even more, any noncitizen who is convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable, according to the Immigration and Nationality Act. Lam could be deported back to Vietnam but has not been deported yet because of an agreement between the United States and Vietnam—which stated that Vietnamese citizens who arrived in the U.S. before July 1995 cannot be sent back to Vietnam. He considered himself as a “stranded deportee,” which means that he is living in the U.S. but can be deported depending on the situation such as change in the MOU.
              <br><br>Many refugees who had incarcerated are living in the fear of deportation. Many of them have no memory of the place that they were born. Furthermore, they have lost the culture and language while they were locked up in prisons. The more difficult thing for them is the fear of being separated from their family if they get deported back—many refugees do not have tie in the country that they were born. Deportation tear their families apart and those families have to live in fractured communities.
